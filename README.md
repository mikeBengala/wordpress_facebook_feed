A wordpress plugin I have developed at work. Facebook Feed for Wordpress

A facebook feed plugin combined with owl carousel makes a carousel of your facebook page posts with pictures, counter of likes/comments/shares, link to the posts on facebook.

Integration is simple

1 - Install the plugin

2 - Get your access tokken from https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer 

3 - Paste your access tokken on the FB Feed Settings option page (On your wordpress pannel left sidebar)

4 - Use this shortcode were you want it to show [gfn_fb_feed]

(This plugins has not been thoroughly tested, integration steps may be missing)
